## TODO
This project is really tangled up, don't really know what to do

Doing things 'the standard way' really pays off, I should try to do that with this proj

- App should ask if I wan't to delete the `.thumbnails` directory. OK!

- `video-thumbnail` needs to be shorter and have a lower fps. OK!
- `video-thumbnail` should compress portrait video the right way. OK!
