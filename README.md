### Making displaying and browsing images and videos a breeze
In a nutshell, GNOME (and possibly more desktop's) picture viewer sucks. This package is yet another attemp at making a comfortable image-viewer. Thank you for checking it out.

Install as global package:

	npm i -g imageinary

This piece of work is meant to be a kitchen sink, and as as such no module support for other apps exists (yet!)
